# laravel-vue-api

The backend is developped by php framework Laravel as it is easy to handle with a rich community and documentation, also it is based on the MVC architecture.

The frontend on the other hand is developped with Javascript framework VueJs, the framework is easy to use with it seperation of html templates and javascript logic.

The project has 2 crud systems for users and groups, unfortunatly i couldn't build an authentication system as i couldn't persist the session and i didn't want to use 3rd party packages to manage it.

If i had more time, i would've made it with the react framework as it was part of the challenge.
